Project Description 

ColdStone â€“ A proposal for a real time problem faced by many ice cream parlor chains for efficient utilization of cost and resource. Integration of web, mobile application and embedded system is used for this application. 

Weight of an object is automatically read and uploaded to the web server. Merchant has to enter the username in the site and bill it to the user. Username is validated and processed accordingly. Customer can login via mobile app and approve or reject the transaction (Future changes to the application can include extending this service to include payment portal to complete the transaction)

The purchase is completed once it is approved by customer. Track of previous transaction can be viewed from mobile application menu option.    

Develop a REST service using the weight calculated by the Flexi Sensor. An Adrunio controller reads the weight value from the Flexi sensor and is processed by a python script which in turn sends the value to a web server 
and to an Android device using REST API.

Technologies : Java, J2EE, Jersey Framework, Python and Android
